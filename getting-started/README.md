# Overview

This guide demonstrates how to leverage Secret Network's advanced blockchain-as-a-service capabilities. By integrating Secret Network with Polygon, users can execute contracts on Polygon while benefiting from Secret Network's privacy features. This approach ensures robust security on the primary blockchain while utilizing Secret Network for secure, external computations.

Our goal is to establish a secure method for sharing documents on the blockchain with designated recipients. This addresses a vital need for businesses and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that require the sharing of sensitive and confidential data. The main challenge has been maintaining privacy when sharing documents on-chain. We believe that Secret Network's innovative technology can effectively solve this problem, allowing individuals to share documents securely with guaranteed privacy and encryption. This solution revolutionizes the sharing of confidential information within the blockchain ecosystem.

This project introduces an SDK that enables anyone to store and share confidential documents, harnessing the capabilities of Secret Network while operating on an EVM chain.
