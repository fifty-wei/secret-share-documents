# Overview

This guide demonstrates how to leverage Secret Network's advanced blockchain-as-a-service capabilities. By integrating Secret Network with Polygon, users can execute contracts on Polygon while benefiting from Secret Network's privacy features. This approach ensures robust security on the primary blockchain while utilizing Secret Network for secure, external computations.

Our goal is to provide a secure method for sharing documents on the blockchain with designated recipients,Secret Network's technology solves the challenge of maintaining privacy when sharing on-chain documents, offering secure, encrypted document sharing within the blockchain ecosystem.

This project introduces an SDK that enables anyone to store and share confidential documents, harnessing the capabilities of Secret Network while operating on an EVM chain.
